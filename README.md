# Arctos-Workflows
Standard Arctos tasks broken down into manageable steps

## Purpose of this Repo
This repo is for Arctos users who want to track the standard operating steps to accomplish regular tasks in Arctos, such as inviting new Arctos Operators, creating containers, using the bulkloader for a specific collection. If you don't see a workflow you would like to use, make one yourself or request it.

## Using this site
- Go to the Issues tab and select a workflow (Click on Get Started next to the appropriate template).
- Assign the issue to yourself on the right under Assignees (makes it easier to find again!)
- Edit the issue from the template to your needs and start using by checking off the to-do boxes as you complete them
