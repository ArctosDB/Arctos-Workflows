**Transcribe the inventory**
- [ ] Enter the data into excel if it isn't already typed (all catalog numbers in one column, all disposition in the next column).

**Check for Discrepencies**
Almost all specimens are stored in one location. We can use this fact to catch invetory mistakes and misplaced specimens.
- [ ] Check for Discrepencies within the current inventory.
   - Select the catalog numbers in the excel sheet and use conditional formatting > highlight cell rules > duplicate values.
- [ ] Check for discrepancies in the database.
   - Use [make comma list](https://arctos.database.museum/DataServices/listerizer.cfm) to [search](https://arctos.database.museum/nmmnh_paleo) for all specimens in the inventory.
- [ ] Compile all discrepancies into an excel sheet and print.
